Experience the world in a creative, productive and unexpected way.

This website shows applications and services that use OSM data. The list of applications is taken from the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/). It crawls all pages that use a [Software](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Template:Software) or [Service item](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Template:Service_item) template an extract the informations about the application.

## Is this map also available as an app?

You can add this map to your homescreen from your smartphone. Use the "add to homescreen" function in your browser (iOS, Android, etc.)

## How can I add a application to the list?

Thank you very much for your commitment!

Create a wiki Page about your app in the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/) and use the [Software template](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Template:Software) to describe your app. Or add your app to the [List of OSM-based services](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/List_of_OSM-based_services) by using the [Service item template](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Template:Service_item).

## How can I remove a application from the list?

Delete the Software or Service item template about the app from the wiki page or mark the website link to app as offline with `<s>...</s>` or `<strike>...</strike>`.

## Is there anything else to do?

Sure, helping hands are always welcome and there is something for everyone to do.

### Do you like to check and clean up?
Improve the documentation about Software in the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/) and the Service items in the [List of OSM-based services](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/List_of_OSM-based_services).

* Move services that are offline, but whose source code still exists, to the offline section (otherwise remove it)
* Mark regional maps with local
* Reorganize the categories and services
* Add missing services
* Replace http with https where possible
* Clean up names, replace domains/url with description from the website title
* Add missing screenshots
* Sort the tables

### Can you program?

Then improve this app catalog and send me a Pull Requests. [Click here to go to the project website of the osm apps catalog](https://github.com/ToastHawaii/osm-apps-catalog)

## I cannot program, how can I create my own theme map?

Try one of the following services:

- [MapContrib](https://www.mapcontrib.xyz/) ([Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapContrib))
- [uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/) ([Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/UMap))
- [overpass turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) ([Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_turbo)) You can use the "Wizard" to create a query, it also understands words like " Lake", " Bakery" and so on
